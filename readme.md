# swsp - SolidWorks Standard Primitives

## Usage

After installation a tab labeled "Standard Primitives"
should appear in the Command Manager, while in the part mode.

## What it can do?

**swsp** is a set of few standard primitive macros, aimed at shortening the time required to
create new part in SolidWorks, by automating some repetitive tasks.

Currently, the addin contains following sketch macros:

* L-profile
* U-profile
* T-profile (closed)
* Hexagon
* Circle
* Rectangle
* Circle with revolve axis
* Rectangle with revolve axis

## Requirements

SWSP requires [.NET 3.5 Framework[(http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21)
to run, and, obviously, [SolidWorks](http://www.solidworks.com/).
The tool was developed & tested with SolidWorks 2013 & 2014.
